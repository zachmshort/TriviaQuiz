# TriviaQuiz

This is the fourth challenge in the DU Coding Bootcamp. Being an even number challenge, all of the code was written from scratch, I utilized W3 schools a lot on the project. I tried to hit as many of the MVP requirements as possible but external circumstances made it difficult for me to complete the project. It is a trivia quiz with fun facts where the user will be prompted to answer one multiple choice question after the other as a timer ticks down. When the user's time is fully expended or they answer all the questions they will inut a name and their score will be displayed.
